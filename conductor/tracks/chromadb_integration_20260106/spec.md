# Track Spec: Integrate ChromaDB for Persistent Tracking Results

## Overview
This track focuses on adding a persistent storage layer to Project Spectrum using ChromaDB. This will allow the system to store tracking data, including bounding boxes, timestamps, and semantic descriptions generated by the VLM, for historical search and retrieval.

## Goals
- Implement a `DatabaseManager` class to handle interactions with ChromaDB.
- Define a schema for storing tracking results and their associated vector embeddings.
- Integrate the database storage into the main tracking loop.
- Provide a search interface to query historical tracks by semantic description.

## Requirements
- Support for persistent storage (local or server-based).
- Efficient vector similarity search using ChromaDB's native capabilities.
- Minimal impact on real-time tracking performance (asynchronous writes recommended).
- Data integrity for multi-object tracking sessions.

## Architecture
- `src/utils/db_manager.py`: Main interface for ChromaDB.
- `src/tracking/tracker.py`: Updated to send results to the database.
- `src/search/semantic_search.py`: Utility for querying the vector database.
